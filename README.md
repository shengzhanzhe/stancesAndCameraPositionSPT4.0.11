# FpsCameraStances for SPT

Take full control of your first-person view and weapon handling with this highly customizable mod.

## Features

### Camera Position Control
- Adjust your camera forward/backward, up/down, and sideways
- Fine-tune your view to your personal preference
- Toggle camera position on/off independently

### 3 Custom Weapon Stances
Create up to **3 unique weapon ready positions**, each with:
- **Rotation control**: Pitch (up/down tilt), Yaw (left/right turn), Roll (weapon cant)
- **Position control**: Forward/backward, Up/down, Sideways offsets
- Enable/disable each stance individually in the cycle
- Smooth, adjustable transitions between stances

### Flexible Stance Controls
- **Hotkey Toggle**: Press a single key (default: V) to cycle through stances
  - Works even while holding movement keys (W, A, S, D)
- **Mouse Wheel Cycling** (optional): Hold a modifier key (default: Left Alt) and scroll to cycle stances
  - Scroll up = next stance, scroll down = previous stance
- **Use Only Stances mode**: Skip the default position and cycle only through your custom stances

### Tactical Sprint Animations
- Enable compact tac sprint animations per stance (like Modern Warfare style)
- Configurable limits based on:
  - Weapon weight
  - Weapon length (inventory cells)
  - Weapon ergonomics
  - Special allowance for bullpup weapons

### ADS Behavior
- Option to smoothly reset positions when aiming down sights
- Customizable ADS hand positions and rotations
- Adjustable transition speed for smooth or snappy feel

### Advanced ADS Transitions (Shouldering Effect)
- Optional weapon shouldering animation when aiming down sights
- Simulates the physical motion of bringing a weapon up to aim (Modern Warfare style)
- **Weapon Stats Scaling**: Automatically adjusts based on weapon weight and ergonomics
  - Heavy/low-ergo weapons = slower, more dramatic shouldering
  - Light/high-ergo weapons = fast, subtle shouldering
- Fully customizable throw and settle phases:
  - Forward/upward throw amounts
  - Throw duration and speed
  - Settle speed to ADS position

### Fully Configurable
- All settings adjustable in-game via **BepInEx Configuration Manager** (F1)
- No file editing required - tweak values and see changes instantly
- Advanced settings available for fine-tuning

## Building from Source

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure reference DLLs are in the `References/` folder
3. Run `dotnet build -c Release`
4. Output: `bin/Release/net472/shwngFpsCameraStances4.dll`

## Known Issues

- Stance transition speed modifier affects ADS → stance transition too 
- Ending tactical sprint causes weapon to warp towards low sprint position (Planned to be fixed next)
- It's possible to switch stances while running - because of that, if a stance has tactical sprint enabled, the weapon instantly switches to tactical sprint mode
- Very Rarely, using very high position/rotation offsets causes shouldering the weapon to take full stamina
- ~~Rarely, extreme position/rotation offsets may cause the weapon to briefly fly out of hand (2-3 frames) before safeguard logic corrects it~~ Fixed after physics update

## Planned Features
- Add "aim rattle" sound effect when switching stances
- Make stance transition to use same "shouldering" effect from advanced ads behaviour

## Compatibility

- **SPT Version**: 4.0.11+
- Compatible with most other mods
- May conflict with other stance/weapon position mods
